# Bem vindo ao meu portfólio de Analista de Dados.

Here you will find my professional experiences, skills, tools and projects involving Data Science.

(*take a look at my Data Science [https://grazielejustina.github.io/portfolio-de-projetos*)

As the projects below demonstrate, I am able to implement a complete Data Science project (“end-to-end”), from obtaining business requirements to publishing it in the cloud, including creating tools to access the Machine Learning Models for non-tech people.

## Habilidades:
* **Linguagens de programação:** Python básico, SQL intermediário.
* **Bancos de dados:** SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
* **Visualização de dados:** Linguagem SQL, Power BI intermediário.
* **Conhecimentos de metodos:** Metodologias Ágeis, Product Discovery, Prototipação, Data Driven, Storytelling, DataOps.

## Projetos desenvolvidos:

### Sales Forecast
* **Business Problem:** The CFO of a drugstore chain wanted a sales forecast for each individual store for the next 06 weeks.
* **Solution Strategy:** Following the steps of the CRISP-DM framework, first I performed data analysis to extract insights and validate business hypotheses. Then, I performed the selection and validation of Machine Learning algorithms, choosing XGBoost for the balance between computational performance and accuracy. Finally, I deployed the application in the cloud (Heroku). Access to forecasts is made possible through a Telegram bot created by me.
* **Business Result:** The choosen model presented an absolute mean percentage error (MAPE) of 15%. The expected revenue was in the range of R$ 275.15 - 277.46 (millions R$).Information about the drugstore sales forecasting was shown on a [Telegram Bot](https://t.me/rossmansales_bot).
* **Project:** [**Sales Forecast Drugstores**](https://github.com/joaomj/rossman_main).
